[{"content":"Fermat\u0026rsquo;s little theorem states that for all primes $p$ and integers $a$, $a^p\\equiv a\\mod p$.\nIt is easy to verify that the theorem holds when $p=2$, since $a^2-a\\equiv a(a-1)\\equiv 0\\mod 2$. To prove the theorem, it suffices to consider only the case $a\\ge 0$, because $(-a)^p\\equiv -a^p\\equiv -a\\mod p$ holds whenever the theorem is valid for $a\u003e0$.\nThe theorem is trivially true for $a=0$. Assuming it holds for $a$, we aim to prove it for $a+1$. By induction, the theorem will then be established.\nUsing the Binomial theorem, we expand: $$(a+1)^p=\\sum_{i=0}^p{p\\choose i}a^i=\\sum_{i=0}^p\\frac{p!}{i!(p-i)!}a^i.$$For $0 \u003c i \u003c p$, each term in the above equation has a factor $p$, since $p$ is prime and $i!(p-i)!$ does not contains factor $p$. So we know $$(a+1)^p\\equiv {p\\choose p}a^p+{p\\choose 0}a^0\\equiv a^p+1\\equiv a+1\\mod p.$$In the last step, we used the assumption that the theorem holds for $a$.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/fermat/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFermat\u0026rsquo;s little theorem\u003c/em\u003e states that for all primes $p$ and integers $a$, $a^p\\equiv a\\mod p$.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is easy to verify that the theorem holds when $p=2$, since $a^2-a\\equiv a(a-1)\\equiv 0\\mod 2$.
